Web3 - Crypto Blockchain with NextJS, React, thirdWeb &amp; Sanity

This Dapp requires one to have a crypto wallet such as Metamask and it's suggested you use Chrome, install the Metamask extension 
for authentication and to view your wallet balances, to view your transactions in detail although Metamask maintains a list of your 
transaction, you can use etherscan to view full details of your transactions
